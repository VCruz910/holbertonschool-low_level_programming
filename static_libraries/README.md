##Holberton School Low Level Programing: C - Static Libraries
###Here's what every script / C code does in this directory:
- libmy.a: Static library

- main.h: Contains all prototypes.

- \_putchar.c: Contains the code for \_putchar function.

- create_static_lib.sh: Creates a static library called **_liball.a_** from all the **_.c_**
                        files that are in the current library.
